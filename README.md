# ubume - Golang project template generator
ubume command generate golang project template at current directory. As of version 1.0.0, the ubume command can generate application and library projects.
  
# How to install
## Step.1 Install golang
If you don't install golang in your system, please install Golang first. Check the [Go official website](https://go.dev/doc/install) for how to install golang.
## Step2. Install ubume
```
$ go install github.com/nao1215/ubume/cmd/ubume@latest
```
  
# How to use
## Generate application project
In the following example, the ubume command will generate a sample project. The binary name will be sample, and build using Makefile.
```
$ ubume github.com/nao1215/sample  ※ Argument is same as "$ go mod init"
$ tree sample/
sample/
├── Changelog.md
├── Makefile
├── cmd
│      └── sample
│              ├── doc.go
│              ├── main.go
│              └── main_test.go
└── go.mod

$ cd sample
$ make build
$ ls
Changelog.md  Makefile  cmd  go.mod  sample

$ ./sample 
Hello, World

$ make test
env GOOS=linux go test -v -cover ./... -coverprofile=cover.out
=== RUN   TestHelloWorld
--- PASS: TestHelloWorld (0.00s)
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok      github.com/nao1215/sample/cmd/sample    0.001s  coverage: 50.0% of statements
go tool cover -html=cover.out -o cover.html
```

## Generate library project
```
$ ubume --library github.com/nao1215/sample
$ tree sample/
sample/
├── Changelog.md
├── Makefile
├── doc.go
├── go.mod
├── sample.go
└── sample_test.go
```

# Self-documented Makefile
The Makefile generated by the ubume command is [self-documenting](https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html). When you run the make command, you will see the target list that exists in the Makefile. A help message is showed next to the target name.
```
$ make
build           Build binary 
clean           Clean project
fmt             Format go source code 
test            Start test
vet             Start go vet
```
If you want to add a new target, please comment with **"##"** next to the target. The string after "##" is extracted and used as a help message. An example is shown below.
```
build:  ## Build binary 
	env GO111MODULE=on GOOS=$(GOOS) $(GO_BUILD) $(GO_LDFLAGS) -o $(APP) cmd/sample/main.go

clean: ## Clean project
	-rm -rf $(APP) cover.out cover.html
```
